- Vechicle length and ground clearance are both likely to provide a non-random amount of variance, because the P values are lower than .05. 

- The slope of the linear line is not considered to be 0 because the P value is much smaller than .05. 

- The multiple regression model is effective at predicting mpg with a R squared value of 71.

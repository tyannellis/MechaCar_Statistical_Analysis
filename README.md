- Vechicle length and ground clearance are both likely to provide a non-random amount of variance, because the P values are lower than .05. 

- The slope of the line is not considered to be 0 because the P value is much smaller than .05. 

- The model is effective at predicting mpg with a R squared value of 71.

 The requirments for the variance of the suspension coils to not exceed  100 pounds per square inch is met at the total level. As we see the variance is around 67. However, this is not met at all the lots, at lot 3 the variance is 170.
